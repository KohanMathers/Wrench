# Wrench

**Wrench** is a modern, developer-focused Minecraft server engine built on [Minestom](https://minestom.net/).
It exists for one reason: to give developers full control without the usual headaches.

Wrench is designed with clarity, modularity, and experimentation in mind.

Made for devs, by a dev with arguably too much time and too many opinions.
